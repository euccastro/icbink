Make a few Kernel types, convert the syntactic entities to these using a Visitor.

Make a basic interpreter:
    environments
        Use dictionaries to begin with; later we can optimize these by converting them to maps:

            Maybe we can use some of Pycket's environment optimizations.  Study them while keeping in mind that Kernel has first class environments. 
    continuations
        Use Pycket's trampoline-based implementation
        Do Guarded continuations pretty early, because that's where I perceive the biggest risk and complication, and it may be traumatic to retrofit later on
    start with immutable lists
    don't worry about cyclic lists in the beginning
        and maybe don't ever, esp. if I stick to immutable lists
