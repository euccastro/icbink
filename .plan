Work on compliance with kplts

Make pythonify_list signal a proper Kernel type/value error

Main concepts not done yet:
    Ports

Go back and revisit the full R-1RK for compliance.
    More tests for everything, esp. guarded continuations.
        Launch tests as a separate project, import as submodule?
        Pilfer tests from SINK, Klisp and others.
            Maybe when I get closer to claiming feature completeness?
            Try and compile a pure-Kernel test suite that other implementations can use to test for conformance?
                Community effort?

Better error messages:
    source_pos
    jump right into debugger?

--- Postponed

Documentation for hackers:
    non-rpython branch.

case insensitive identifiers


Better parsing error messages.

breakpoints in debugger?

inherit source positions wherever it makes sense
    YAGNI?

Optimize dictionaries using maps:

    Maybe we can use some of Pycket's environment optimizations.  Study them while keeping in mind that Kernel has first class environments.

Consider Kernel-compliant handling of cyclic lists.

Consider mutable lists.

start with immutable lists

story of a combination:
    we interpret a pair
    on interpretation, we evaluate the car, with a CombineCont continuation
    the prev of the CombineCont is the continuation that is expecting the value
        but it doesn't have the right source info because it corresponds to 'upper' in the code
    we may be interested in returning to this place from a continuation where we are
        evaluating the arguments
        evaluating the body of the operative
    CombineCont calls combine on the first arg on plug_reduce *and its own prev expression as the prev*.
        THEREFORE, THE COMBINECONT ITSELF IS NOT REACHABLE ANYMORE!
        The combiner of a primitive operative is not very interesting; just calls primitive code
        The combiner of a compound operative builds the right environment and calls `sequence` (again, on the continuation previous to the combinecont)
        The combiner of an applicative calls evaluate_arguments with an ApplyCont child of the prev.
            def evaluate_arguments(vals, env, cont):
                if isinstance(vals, Pair):
                    return vals.car, env, EvalArgsCont(vals.cdr, env, cont)
                else:
                    return vals, env, cont
            EvalArgsCont, in turn, calls evaluate_arguments with a GatherArgsCont
