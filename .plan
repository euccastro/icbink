Make a basic interpreter:
    Do Guarded continuations pretty early, because that's where I perceive the biggest risk and complication, and it may be traumatic to retrofit later on

Check out pypy/rpython/rlib/parsing/lexer.py:SourcePos when we want to use source position for debugging and exceptions.
Optimize dictionaries using maps:

    Maybe we can use some of Pycket's environment optimizations.  Study them while keeping in mind that Kernel has first class environments.
Consider Kernel-compliant handling of cyclic lists.
Consider mutable lists.

start with immutable lists
don't worry about cyclic lists in the beginning
    and maybe don't ever, esp. if I stick to immutable lists
