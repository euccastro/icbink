 Icbink 0.0.0

This aims to be a practical and robust (but not necessarily complete) implementation of `The Kernel Programming Language`_ in RPython_.  This should give us an optimizing JIT compiler almost for free (see `Laurence Tratt's excellent article`_ for more details.)

At the moment guarded continuations look like they're working.  We also have the beginnings of a rudimentary command-line debugger.

Sources of inspiration/pilfering:

* Sam Tobin-Hochstad et al., pycket_: Racket implementation in RPython

* Mariano Guerra's plang_: another shot at Kernel in RPython

* John Shutt's SINK_: scheme-based Kernel implementation

* Queinnec's `Lisp in Small Pieces`_

* Andr√©s Navarro's Klisp_: to my knowledge, the most mature and complete implementation to date.
